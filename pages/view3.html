                        Rio de Janeiro is located on the Atlantic Ocean,
                        in the southeastern part of the tropical zone of South America,
                        and is widely recognized as one of the world’s 
                        most beautiful and interesting urban centres. 
                        Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent
                        icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, 
                        in reality its location, architecture, inhabitants, 
                        and lifestyle make it highly unique. 
                        Rio de Janeiro is well known for the beauty of its beaches 
                        and of its peaks, ridges, and hills—all partly covered by 
                        tropical forests. The city is a centre of leisure for Brazilian 
                        and foreign tourists. Perhaps at no time is the city’s festive 
                        reputation better displayed than during the annual pre-Lenten Carnival, 
                        which enlivens the city night and day with music, singing, parties, balls, 
                        and street parades of brilliantly costumed dancers performing to samba rhythms. 
                        Rio is also an important economic centre, however, with activities ranging 
                        from industry and national and international trade to administration, banking, 
                        education, culture, and research.
